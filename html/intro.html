                <h4>First of all, a small disclaimer:</h4> <br>
                I created this page after several days of me trying get to JavaScript, HTML, CSS and jQuery. 
                I did not copy any templates or whole block of codes. 
                I try to build page on my own and google certain tags or attributes to be used to my best knowledge. 
                I am planning to get better within this area purely as part of my hobbies. There is a high chance of me creating a newer version of this page
                with more modern design and features. Stay tuned !
            </p>

            <h4>
                That being said, its finally time to introduce myself:
